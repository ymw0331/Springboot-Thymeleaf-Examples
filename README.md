What is Thymeleaf?

Thymeleaf is a modern server-side Java template engine for both web and standalone environments, capable of processing HTML, XML, JavaScript, CSS, and even plain text.

The main goal of Thymeleaf is to provide an elegant and highly-maintainable way of creating templates.

It's commonly used to generate HTML views for web applications.
